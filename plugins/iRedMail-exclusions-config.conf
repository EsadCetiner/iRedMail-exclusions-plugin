# Rule ID block base: 9,518,000 - 9,518,999
# Plugin version: 1.0.0

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the iRedMail-exclusions-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# iRedMail-exclusions-plugin=0
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
# Uncomment to disable this plugin

#   pass,\
#   nolog,\
#   ver:'iRedMail-exclusions-plugin/1.0.0',\
#   setvar:'tx.iRedMail-exclusions-plugin=0'"

# This variable controls what portions of the plugin is activated and what is deactivated.
# By default, it is assumed you are running iRedMail with RoundCube Webmail and iRedAdmin.
# if you are not using RoundCube Webmail with iRedAdmin, you can tell the plugin how your iRedMail is setup here.
#
# Value of 0 = RoundCube Webmail + iRedAdmin open source (Default)

# Value of 2 = Roundcube Webmail standalone
# Value of 3 = SOGo Webmail standalone
# Value of 4 = iRedAdmin standalone
